    "### 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence modeling and transduction tasks, such as language modeling and machine translation, were typically addressed with RNNs and CNNs. However, these architectures are limited by: (i) ``long training times``, due to the sequential nature of RNNs, which constrains parallelization, and results in increased memory and computational demands as the text sequence grows; and (ii) ``difficulty in learning dependencies between distant positions``, where CNNs, although much less sequential than RNNs, require a number of steps to integrate information that is, in most cases, correlated (linearly for models like ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet) with the distance between elements in the sequence."

    "### 2. Technical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces the novel Transformer model, ``a stacked encoder-decoder architecture that utilizes self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence and convolution to compute input and output representations``. In this model, each of the six layers of both the encoder and decoder is composed of two main sub-layers: a multihead self-attention sub-layer, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward sub-layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the ``self-attention mechanism`` enables the model to weigh the relationships between input tokens at different positions, resulting in a more effective handling of long-range dependencies. Additionally, by integrating ``multiple attention heads``, the model gains the ability to simultaneously attend to various aspects of the input data during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the proposed implementation, the input and output tokens are converted to 512-dimensional embeddings, to which ``positional embeddings`` are added, enabling the model to use sequence order information."

    "\n",
    "The intuition behind ``self-attention`` is that averaging token embeddings instead of using a fixed embedding for each token, enables the model to capture how words relate to each other in the input. In practice, said weighted relationships (attention weights) represent the syntactic and contextual structure of the sentence, leading to a more nuanced and rich understanding of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to implement a self-attention layer is based on ``scaled dot-product attention``, which involves:\n",
    "1. ``Linear projection`` of each token embedding into three vectors: ``query (q)``, ``key (k)``, ``value (v)``.\n",
    "2. Compute ``scaled attention scores``: determine the similary between ``q`` and ``k`` by applying the ``dot product``. Since the results of this function are typically large numbers, they are then divided by a scaling factor inferred from the dimensionality of (k). This scaling contributes to stabilize gradients during training.\n",
    "3. Normalize the ``attention scores`` into ``attention weights`` by applying the ``softmax`` function (this ensures all the values sum to 1).\n",

    "The Transformer, primarily built upon linear operations like ``dot products`` and ``linear projections``, relies on the ``Position-Wise Feed-Forward Layer`` to introduce non-linearity into the model.

Each layer in the ``Encoder`` and ``Decoder`` includes one of these feed-forward networks, allowing the model to build increasingly abstract representations of the input data as it passes through successive layers. Note that since this layer processes each embedding independly, the computations can be fully parallelized.\n",

In practice, ``GELU`` has been the preferred choice in the BERT and GPT models."
